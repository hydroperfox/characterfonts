# Character fonts

The following two are the fonts I prefer to look at.

* Common font = (open = [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)) + (commercial = Segoe UI) + variable weight
* Code font = (open = Bitstream Vera Sans Mono) + (open = Liberation Mono) + (system = Courier New) + regular

Details:

* Open Sans is close to Segoe UI, and is commonly used in the Metro design.
* "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono" and "Liberation Mono" are metrically closest to Courier New.
